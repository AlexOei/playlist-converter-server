# playlist-converter
Allows the conversion of playlists to and from Spotify and Apple Music with the use of service specific song IDs and ISRC codes

Known bugs: On occasion, Spotify and Apple Music do not use the same ISRC code for a song, which prevents said song from being converted. A duplicate of another song is added to the new playlist. Planning a fix using album and song names in those edge cases.
